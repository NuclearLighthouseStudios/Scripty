# Welcome to Scripty, the stupid teleprompter!

**Hey, I'm Scripty!** I'm here to help you with your telepromtering!

You can run me on your local network to help you write a script on your big computer using markdown and have the formatted output show up on a tablet or something!

<sup>Running me on the internet is probably a bad idea since I'm not very secure…</sup>

Just paste your script into the window and click the big friendly `View your script!` button in the lower right. You can open that link on any device on your local network for making your videos. It even updates live for those important last minute script changes!

I don't have very good memory, so it's best to keep your script safe somewhere else cause I'll forget about it when you restart me…

<sup>Also, I don't do any automatic scrolling or anything, sorry.</sup>

    \{^°-°^}/~ <3 Scripty loves you!
